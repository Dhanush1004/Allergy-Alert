# ALLERGYALERT: Intelligent Food Allergy Detection using AI and Ingredient Analysis

## Project Overview
**ALLERGYALERT** is an AI-powered web application designed to help users detect potential allergens in packaged food items by analyzing their ingredient labels.  
By uploading an image of the foodâ€™s ingredient list, the system uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to detect whether any ingredient could trigger an allergic reaction for a particular user.  

This system is especially useful for people suffering from food allergies such as **nut allergy**, **lactose intolerance**, **gluten sensitivity**, and **shellfish allergy**.

---

## Problem Definition
Food allergies are a serious global health concern â€” even small traces of allergens can lead to severe reactions or life-threatening anaphylaxis.  
Many packaged food items list ingredients in small or unclear text, and users might not recognize all chemical or alternative names of allergens (e.g., *casein = milk protein*, *albumin = egg-based compound*).

### Thus, people with allergies face major difficulties:
- Manually reading every food label  
- Not identifying hidden or alternative allergen names  
- Lack of personalized digital tools for allergy checking

## Existing Methods & Their Issues

| **Existing Solution** | **Description** | **Limitations** |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Manual label reading | Users read ingredients manually | Time-consuming, error-prone |
| Generic food scanner apps | OCR or barcode scanning for nutrition | Do not focus on allergens or personalization |
| Allergy databases | Contain lists of allergens | Not integrated with real-time image detection |
| Ingredient translators | Translate food labels | Donâ€™t alert based on personal allergy data |

Hence, an **AI-based system** is needed that can understand ingredients intelligently and alert users based on their personal allergy profile.

---

## Proposed Methodology

1. **User Login / Registration**  
   Users create an account and set up their allergy profile (e.g., peanuts, dairy, gluten).

2. **Ingredient Image Upload**  
   Users upload an image of a food package ingredient label.

3. **AI & OCR Processing**  
   The system extracts text from the image using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

4. **Ingredient Analysis**  
   The extracted ingredients are analyzed using AI/NLP models to identify allergens, including hidden or related chemical names.

5. **Alert Generation**  
   If any allergen matches the userâ€™s allergy profile, an alert is displayed notifying potential risk.

6. **Dashboard & Reports**  
   Displays safe/unsafe food items history for the user.

## Tech Stack Used

### Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- React.js / Express.js for interactive UI  
- Bootstrap / TailwindCSS for responsive design  

### Backend
- Python (Flask / FastAPI) or Node.js (Express) for server logic  
- AI/ML Model for ingredient classification and allergy detection  

### AI/ML & NLP Tools
- **Tesseract OCR** â€“ for text extraction from food images  
- **spaCy / NLTK / Transformers (BERT)** â€“ for ingredient name understanding and allergen matching  
- **Custom trained model** for allergen classification  

### Database
- **MongoDB** â€“ for storing user profiles, allergy preferences, and history  

### Deployment
- **Render / Vercel / AWS / Heroku** (for frontend & backend)  
- **MongoDB Atlas** (for cloud database)
